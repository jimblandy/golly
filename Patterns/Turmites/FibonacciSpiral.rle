# Specification string: {{{1, 8, 1}, {1, 8, 1}}, {{1, 2, 1}, {0, 1, 0}}}
#
# This string is a curly-bracketed table of n_states rows and n_colors columns, 
# where each entry is a triple of integers. The elements of each triple are:
# - new color of the square
# - direction(s) for the turmite to turn: 1=noturn, 2=right, 4=u-turn, 8=left
# - new internal state of the turmite
# 
# For example, the triple {1,8,1} says: 
# - set the color of the square to 1
# - turn left (8)
# - adopt state 1 and move forward one square
#
# To generate Turmites like this one, run this script:

x = 1, y = 1, rule = Turmite_181181121010
