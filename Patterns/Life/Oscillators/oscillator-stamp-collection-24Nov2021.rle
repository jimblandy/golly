#N oscillator-stamp-collection-24Nov2021.rle
#O Dean Hickerson, David Raucci, et al., updated Nov 24, 2021
#C A collection of 1064 oscillators of 138 different periods from 1
#C to 40894. To see LifeViewer labels, run showinviewer.lua in Golly.
#C To turn off labels in LifeViewer, press Alt+L.
#C
#C Notes from Dean Hickerson:
#C The oscillators included here were found/built by many people over
#C many years.  I finished putting the collection together in August 1995,
#C and have worked on this header file off and on since then.  It's still
#C incomplete and probably inaccurate, but I've decided to make it public anyway.
#C Since this collection was built, many new oscillators have been found.
#C Most notably, in 1996 David Buckingham showed how to create tracks
#C built from still-lifes through which Herschels can move.  (See
#C  https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/bhept/bhept.html
#C for Buckingham's description of this, and
#C  https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/p1/p1.html
#C for Paul Callahan's discussion of using such conduits to build a stable
#C glider reflector.)  Using Herschel tracks, Buckingham obtained glider
#C guns of all periods >= 62 and oscillators of all periods >= 61.  Further
#C work on Herschel tracks has been done by Buckingham, Paul Callahan,
#C Dieter Leithner, and me; such tracks now give oscillators of all periods
#C >=54, and guns of periods 54, 55, and 56. In addition, the 2013 discovery
#C of the Snark allowed all oscillators of all periods 43 and higher.
#C There are 4 periods for which oscillators are still unknown as of
#C late 2021: 19, 34, 38, and 41. (For period 34, we could use a noninteracting
#C combination of p2 and p17 oscillators, but that's considered trivial.)
#C
#C Building this collection would have been impossible without the help
#C of many people.  In addition to those who found the oscillators, I'd
#C like to thank Alan Hensel, Bill Gosper, Robert Wainwright,
#C Rich Schroeppel, and Jonathan Cooley for helpful suggestions, and
#C Andrew Trevorrow for writing LifeLab, an excellent Macintosh program
#C for building and running Life patterns.  LifeLab's cross-platform
#C successor, Golly, is available as freeware at http://golly.sf.net .

#C Notes from David Raucci:
#C If you find any errors or can fill in any of the blanks, please
#C let me know. This file has been updated in 2020 and 2021, converting it
#C to a Python program that automatically updates based on a text file input
#C and includes more oscillators that were not known in 1995.

#C
#C Most lines of this header describe particular oscillators.  Each entry
#C begins with an identifying label, of the form "period.row.column";
#C row and column numbers start at zero.  This is followed by the name of
#C the oscillator (if any) in quotation marks, the discoverer and date of
#C discovery (if known) in brackets, and perhaps a comment about the
#C oscillator.  For example:
#C
#C     2.0.0   "blinker"  [JHC 3/70]  Example of "+c*c" symmetry.  This
#C             often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "traffic light",
#C             which arises, for example, from a T-tetromino. 
#C
#C This indicates that the leftmost oscillator in the top row of the period 2
#C section is called a "blinker", and was found by John Conway in March 1970.
#C The notation "+c*c" indicates the symmetry type of the oscillator, which
#C is described later.
#C
#C Many oscillators were found by the following people or groups, so their
#C names are abbreviated in this header:

#C                 Richard Howell, Rici Liknaitzky, Bill Mann,
#C                 Rich Schroeppel, and Michael Speciner.
#C 
#C Also, many of the common oscillators were found independently by many
#C people; this is indicated by an asterisk in the name field.
#C
#C Here are definitions of some terminology and notation used below; for
#C a more extensive glossary, see Stephen Silver's Life Lexicon, at
#C  http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm 
#C 
#C The 'rotor' consists of all cells in an oscillator which change state.
#C The 'stator' consists of all cells which are alive in all generations.
#C (These terms were introduced by Allan Wechsler in 1994.)
#C
#C An oscillator whose stator is large is often called a 'billiard table';
#C such oscillators are somewhat easier to find than others, so many are
#C included in this collection.
#C
#C The 'period' of an oscillator (or spaceship) is the smallest positive
#C integer P for which generation P of the object is congruent to and in
#C the same orientation as generation 0.  The 'mod' of an oscillator (or
#C spaceship) is the smallest positive integer M for which generation M
#C of the object is congruent to generation 0, but not necessarily in the
#C same orientation.  The quotient q=P/M is always either 1, 2, or 4.  To
#C specify both P and M, we often write "period P.M" or "period P/q".
#C
#C There are 43 types of symmetry that an oscillator can have, taking into
#C account both the symmetry of a single generation and the change of
#C orientation (if any) M generations later.  There are 16 types of
#C symmetry that a pattern can have in a single generation.  Each of these
#C is given a one or two character name, as follows:
#C 
#C    n   no symmetry
#C 
#C    -c  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell centers
#C    -e  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell edges
#C 
#C    /   mirror symmetry across one diagonal
#C 
#C    .c  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    .e  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell edge
#C    .k  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    +c  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell center
#C    +e  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell edge
#C    +k  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell corner
#C 
#C    xc  mirror symmetry across 2 diagonals meeting at a cell center
#C    xk  mirror symmetry across 2 diagonals meeting at a cell corner
#C 
#C    rc  90 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    rk  90 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    *c  8-fold symmetry about a cell center
#C    *k  8-fold symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C For a period P/1 object, specifying the symmetry of generation 0 tells
#C us all there is to know about the oscillator's symmetry.  For a period
#C P/2 or P/4 object, we also need to know how gen M is related to gen 0.
#C For the P/2 case, gen M can be either a mirror image of gen 0, a 180
#C degree rotation of it, or a 90 degree rotation of it if the pattern
#C has 180 degree rotational symmetry.  For the P/4 case gen M must be a
#C 90 degree rotation of gen 0.  In any case, if we merge all gens which
#C are multiples of M, the resulting pattern will have more symmetry than
#C the original oscillator.  We describe the complete symmetry class of
#C the oscillator by appending the one or two character description of
#C the union's symmetry to that of gen 0's symmetry.  For example, if
#C gen 0 has 180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center, and
#C gen M is obtained by reflecting gen 0 across a diagonal, then the
#C union of gens 0 and M is symmetric across both diagonals, so its
#C symmetry class is denoted ".cxc".
#C 
#C The 43 possible symmetry types are:
#C 
#C    period/mod = 1:  nn    -c-c  -e-e  //    .c.c  .e.e  .k.k  +c+c
#C                     +e+e  +k+k  xcxc  xkxk  rcrc  rkrk  *c*c  *k*k
#C 
#C    period/mod = 2:  n-c   n-e   n/    n.c   n.e   n.k
#C                     -c+c  -c+e  -e+e  -e+k
#C                     /xc   /xk
#C                     .c+c  .cxc  .crc  .e+e  .k+k  .kxk  .krk
#C                     +c*c  +k*k  xc*c  xk*k  rc*c  rk*k
#C 
#C    period/mod = 4:  nrc   nrk
#C 
#C The collection includes examples of all of these with mod=1, and many
#C with larger periods.

#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C To add an oscillator to oscillators.txt, all you need is the RLE and
#C optional comments. Make sure that there is no more than one #N or #O,
#C and #N comes before #O comes before #C. If the period is 1000 or more,
#C put a percent sign after the exclamation point at the end of the RLE,
#C and the period number after the percent sign.
#C While the file has oscillators sorted by period, the program will handle
#C them correctly even if they are out of order. If a pattern is not a
#C still life or oscillator, it will exclude it from the pattern, but it
#C will take an extra half second to figure this out unless it completely
#C dies first. Oscillators with width above 120 plus the digit width
#C or period >= 1000 with max bounding box expanding after generation 1000
#C are not supported unless the Python code is modified. ROW_WIDTH can be
#C changed at the top of the code to increase the allowed width above 120.
#C
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C Period 1 oscillators are usually called "still-lifes".  Programs
#C written by MDN and others have counted the still-lifes with N cells
#C for small N; the results up to N=20 are shown here:
#C 
#C N    4 5 6 7 8  9 10 11  12  13  14   15   16   17    18    19     20
#C #    2 1 5 4 9 10 25 46 121 240 619 1353 3286 7773 19044 45759 112243
#C 
#C Those with up to 10 bits are included in the stamp collection.  So are
#C some larger ones that either occur naturally in random soups, or are
#C useful, or exemplify symmetry types.  I'm omitting the discoverers and
#C dates for most of the small and naturally occurring ones, since they've
#C been independently discovered many times.
#C
#C Frequencies listed are for 16x16 soups on an infinite grid. Most objects
#C are 10 percent more common on a large torus (AF 2004, 2048x2048), at the
#C expense of the block, which is about 6 percent less common, and the ship,
#C which goes from 1 in 20 to 1 in 90.
#N 1.0.0 Block [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*k" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in many oscillators, too many to list. Also used as
#C       a 'rephaser' in P135, 150, 230, and 240 oscillators. In 47.0.0, it acts as
#C       an induction coil, preventing a line of 6 from growing new cells.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 2; the most common object in 16x16 soups;
#C       on a large torus, the blinker is slightly more common.
#C 1.0.1 Tub [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*c" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in most p29s, Eureka (P30), and 47.0.0.
#C       A tub can stabilize an exposed line of five. This is usually done when reducing
#C       population is the goal, but this collection is mainly optimized by bounding box,
#C       where snakes are better.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 65
#C 1.0.2 Boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "/" symmetry.
#C       A glider that hits a snake in the correct position will produce a boat while
#C       leaving the snake intact. See P60 section.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.3 Ship [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xc" symmetry.  Used as an
#C       eater of traffic lights in P24, 36, 44, 48, and 92 oscillators.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 20 in 16x16 soups, but this is because
#C       they form from Herschels. On a large torus, they are 1 in 90.
#C 1.0.4 Beehive [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "+e" symmetry.  This
#C       often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "honey farm", which
#C       arises, for example, from a beehive with an extra cell in one
#C       of its corners.
#C       A single beehive is also hassled in a P30 and P35 oscillator.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 4
#C 1.0.5 Aircraft carrier
#C       Example of ".e" symmetry.
#C       One of the 35 hexominoes becomes an aircraft carrier after one generation.
#C       .o..
#C       oooo
#C       ..o.
#C       Despite this, it's still quite rare for a 6-cell pattern, although not as
#C       rare as the snake or the clock.
#C       It's more common in HighLife (B36/S23), as the pi heptomino generates two of them.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 8,000
#C 1.0.6 Barge [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xk" symmetry.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 1,000
#C 1.0.7 Snake [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of ".k" symmetry.  Used in one P60 oscillator, 454.0.0,
#C       and 15240.0.0 to convert a glider into a boat, which a
#C       subsequent glider deletes.
#C       Used as a rock in the conduit "Conduit 1" (aka BFx59H), as seen in
#C       78.0.0, 98.0.0, and 190.0.0.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 30,000; rarest 6-bit still life
#C 1.0.8 Long snake
#C       Also called a python, not to be confused with the programming language
#C       Example of ".c" symmetry.
#C       Rarest of the 7-bit still lifes in natural soups, at 1 in 700,000
#C 1.0.9 Long boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 200
#C 1.0.10 Loaf [JHC group 1970]
#C        Loaves can be flipped easily; this is part of how eater 3 works. See P8, 106,
#C        and 133. Loaves can be flipped in other ways, too; see baker's dozen (P12),
#C        loaflipflop (P15), one of the P20s, zweiback (P30), and popover (P32).
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.11 Eater 1 [* 1971]
#C        Also called a fishhook
#C        This is a very useful still-life,
#C        because of its ability to eat gliders (see period 30 section), beehives
#C        (see period 30 section), and lightweight and middleweight spaceships
#C        (see period 46 section), and to modify many other things.  The term
#C        "eater" also applies to other still-lifes (and occasionally
#C        oscillators) that share this ability; the most useful of these
#C        are the block, eater 2, and eater 3, but
#C        many others are sometimes useful, including the tub,
#C        ship, and snake.
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 5,000
#C        Rarest object that can be the result of a 2-glider collision.

#C       Trans- and cis- have the same meanings as they do in organic chemistry.

#C 28.0.0 [thunk, 2016]
#C 28.0.1
#C        Most known p29 oscillators and some p28s are "pre-pulsar hasslers".
#C        Consider a pair of hollow 3x3 squares, with 3 empty columns between them:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        After 15 generations, this becomes 4 hollow squares:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        (This goes on to become a p3 "pulsar" in gen 20.)  By repeatedly
#C        suppressing 2 of the hollow squares, we obtain oscillators of
#C        periods 30 and 60.
#C        
#C        It's also possible to suppress 2 of the squares in such a way that
#C        the other 2 form in gen 14 instead of 15; this leads to oscillators
#C        with periods 28 and 29.  Originally this required 8 pairs of squares
#C        supporting each other; DJB found the first p28 ("newshuttle", not
#C        included in this collection) in 1973.  Later, several methods were
#C        found which use either 1, 2, or 4 mutually supporting pairs.
#C        
#C        Note that DRH's original collection has more p29s. As many are

#C        Pre-pulsar hassled by four caterers
#C 60.1.2 p60, type -1 toadsucker
#C        A "toad hassler" is an oscillator in which a toad is changed by a
#C        pair of domino sparks above and below it.  It either moves 1 unit
#C        sideways ("toadsucker") or changes its orientation ("toadflipper").
#C        Amazingly, there are 5 different positions for the sparks which
#C        work; I call them "type -1" through "type 3", depending on the
#C        horizontal distance between the top and bottom sparks.  The odd types
#C        are toadsuckers; the even ones are toadflippers.  Given a period N
#C        oscillator which produces accessible domino sparks once per period,
#C        the resulting toad hasslers have period 4N if N is odd, 2N if N is
#C        even.  However, there are also some toad hasslers in which the period
#C        is smaller, either because the sparks occur more than once per period
#C        (see period 58) or because the interaction with the spark is more
#C        complicated (see period 56). Any oscillator that mentions
#C        "see period 60" uses this mechanism. Toad hassling was apparently
#C        first discovered by RTW in 6/84, using sparks from PDs and snackers to
#C        give p60 and p36 oscillators.

#C 184.0.1 P184 glider shuttle [DRH 1/24/92]
#C         Glider shuttle based on 180 degree reflection: a
#C         p46 spark turns the glider into a block; the next spark turns

#C 188.0.0 P188 glider gun [RWG 10/16/94]
#C 188.0.1 Pseudo p94 gun [DJB,RCS,PC 7/11/94]
#C         A pre-honey farm
#C         interacts with an eater and a block, emitting a glider,
#C         creating a traffic light, and forming another pre-honey farm
#C         47 gens later; this reaction is called "AK47".  The new
#C         pre-h.f. interacts with another eater and block to recreate
#C         the original configuration.  Unfortunately, the 2 traffic
#C         lights must be suppressed in order to make the process repeat
#C         every 94 gens.  This reaction was found independently by DJB
#C         and RCS and was known for years before PC found a period 4
#C         oscillator which could suppress the traffic lights.  (A true
#C         p94 gun was built by DRH in 6/90, using 36 AK47s.)

#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 260.0.0 L130 [Entity Valkyrie]
#C         It can be made P520 by including only one Herschel. It cannot be made

#C 270.0.0 P270 glider shuttle [EvinZL 4/10/21]
#C 270.0.1
#C         Every 270 generations, a MWSS is created. However, it cannot
#C         survive; the eater reaction is required for this to remain stable.
#C         Without the glider eater at the bottom, it creates a cycle of 5 escaping,
#C         4 destroyed, repeating.

#C 552.0.0 [RWG ????, DRH 1/23/92 ]
#C         Glider loop based on the same
#C         reflection as in the p138 section.  Here the ponds are deleted by a
#C         p8 blocker.  The period of the loop can be anything of the
#C         form 138+184n, but the period of the oscillator is 4 times that.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 576.0.0 p576 R-pentomino hassler [DER 6/9/21]
#C         Compare to the very similar 486.0.0. It's a very high period R-pentomino
#C         hassler with period prime factorization containing only 2s and 3s, it's
#C         a flipper with 180 degree symmetry, it has blocks as suppressors on the top and
#C         bottom and sparkers on the left and right, and it was found by the same
#C         person in the same year using the same search program.
#C         Unrelated to the above: the blocks on the top and bottom are suppressing Herschels.
#C         It can easily be made into a glider gun. Also, the blocks on the left
#C         and right are optional, but if omitted, they'll form as the oscillator
#C         completes its cycle.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 690.0.0 [DRH 1/3/91]
#C         Sparks from a p46 shuttle interact 6 times with
#C         sparks from a p15 pentadecathlon; one interaction makes a
#C         temporary blinker.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 972.0.0 [Aforampere 5/13/21]
#C         Two p486 R-pentomino hasslers undergo a period-doubling reaction.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 1368.0.0 p1368 LCM loaf flipper [DER 11/1/21]
#C          On the left is two blockers hassling R-pentomino (p72), and on the
#C          right is the p76 pi-heptomino hassler. The LCM of these is 1368.
#C          Also see the period 120 section for the same loaf-flipping reaction
#C          in a different form.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 1380.0.0 p1380 crystallization and decay gun [Entity Valkyrie 5/1/21]
#C          A Tanner's p46 and a twin bees shuttle create a p92 glider gun.
#C          The crystallization and decay releases a glider for every 15 input gliders.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 2700.0.0 p2700 crystallization and decay oscillator [DRH 3/27/90]
#C          Extensible to period 2700+1950N.  A p150 gun shoots gliders
#C          toward a pair of PDs.  The first is reflected 180 degrees
#C          and hits the second, forming a honey farm.  Subsequent
#C          gliders grow a crystal back toward the gun; every 11
#C          gliders add another pair of beehives to the crystal.
#C          Eventually, an eater stops the growth and the crystal
#C          begins to decay: two successive gliders delete one pair of
#C          beehives.  (This is based on an earlier pattern found and
#C          lost by RWG, using a p46 gun.)
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 15240.0.0 p120-based PRNG [DRH 3/21/92]
#C           Pseudo random number generator,
#C           based on an earlier pattern by RWG (a larger
#C           version of 40894.0.0).  Produces a sequence of bits b[n],
#C           represented by gliders, satisfying the recurrence
#C           b[n] = b[n-1] XOR b[n-7].  The sequence has period 127,
#C           so the period of the pattern is 120*127.  Increasing the
#C           separation between the NW and SE parts by 15N units
#C           diagonally changes the 7 above to K=7+N  (N >= -4).  The
#C           period of the sequence depends rather erratically on K:
#C           
#C           K | 2 3  4  5  6   7  8  9  10   11   12   13    14    15

#C           
#C           Also see 40894.0.0.  (In 1996, DRH built a p30-based PRNG.)
#C           This uses a "boat-bit", a reaction in which gliders hitting
#C           a snake alternately create and destroy a boat. 
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 40894.0.0 p46-based PRNG
#C           RWG ????, DRH 1/10/95
#C           Pseudo random LWSS generator. Produces a sequence of bits b[n],
#C           represented by LWSSs, satisfying the recurrence
#C           b[n] = b[n-1] EQV b[n-10].  The sequence has period 889,
#C           so the period of the pattern is 46*889. Moving the bottom
#C           right gun and the reflector at the right edge 46N units
#C           farther right changes the 10 above to  K=10+4N  (N>=0).
#C           The period of the sequence depends on K as indicated in
#C           the description of 15240.0.0.


#N Oscillator stamp collection
#O Dean Hickerson, David Raucci, et al., updated Nov 24, 2021
#C A collection of 1064 oscillators of 138 different periods from 1
#C to 40894. 
#C
#C Notes from Dean Hickerson:
#C The oscillators included here were found/built by many people over
#C many years.  I finished putting the collection together in August 1995,
#C and have worked on this header file off and on since then.  It's still
#C incomplete and probably inaccurate, but I've decided to make it public anyway.
#C Since this collection was built, many new oscillators have been found.
#C Most notably, in 1996 David Buckingham showed how to create tracks
#C built from still-lifes through which Herschels can move.  (See
#C  https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/bhept/bhept.html
#C for Buckingham's description of this, and
#C  https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/p1/p1.html
#C for Paul Callahan's discussion of using such conduits to build a stable
#C glider reflector.)  Using Herschel tracks, Buckingham obtained glider
#C guns of all periods >= 62 and oscillators of all periods >= 61.  Further
#C work on Herschel tracks has been done by Buckingham, Paul Callahan,
#C Dieter Leithner, and me; such tracks now give oscillators of all periods
#C >=54, and guns of periods 54, 55, and 56. In addidion, the 2013 discovery
#C of the Snark allowed all oscillators of all periods 43 and higher.
#C There are 4 periods for which oscillators
#C are still unknown as of early 2021: 19, 34, 38, and 41.
#C (For period 34, we could use a noninteracting combination of p2 and p17
#C oscillators, but that's considered trivial.)
#C
#C Building this collection would have been impossible without the help
#C of many people.  In addition to those who found the oscillators, I'd
#C like to thank Alan Hensel, Bill Gosper, Robert Wainwright,
#C Rich Schroeppel, and Jonathan Cooley for helpful suggestions, and
#C Andrew Trevorrow for writing LifeLab, an excellent Macintosh program
#C for building and running Life patterns.  LifeLab's cross-platform
#C successor, Golly, is available as freeware at http://golly.sf.net .

#C
#C Most lines of this header describe particular oscillators.  Each entry
#C begins with an identifying label, of the form "period.row.column";
#C row and column numbers start at zero.  This is followed by the name of
#C the oscillator (if any) in quotation marks, the discoverer and date of
#C discovery (if known) in brackets, and perhaps a comment about the
#C oscillator.  For example:
#C
#C     2.0.0   "blinker"  [JHC 3/70]  Example of "+c*c" symmetry.  This
#C             often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "traffic light",
#C             which arises, for example, from a T-tetromino. 
#C
#C This indicates that the leftmost oscillator in the top row of the period 2
#C section is called a "blinker", and was found by John Conway in March 1970.
#C The notation "+c*c" indicates the symmetry type of the oscillator, which
#C is described later.
#C
#C Many oscillators were found by the following people or groups, so their
#C names are abbreviated in this header:

#C                 Rich Schroeppel, and Michael Speciner.
#C 
#C Also, many of the common oscillators were found independently by many
#C people; this is indicated by an asterisk in the name field.
#C
#C Here are definitions of some terminology and notation used below; for
#C a more extensive glossary, see Stephen Silver's Life Lexicon, at
#C  http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm 
#C 
#C The 'rotor' consists of all cells in an oscillator which change state.
#C The 'stator' consists of all cells which are alive in all generations.
#C (These terms were introduced by Allan Wechsler in 1994.)
#C
#C An oscillator whose stator is large is often called a 'billiard table';
#C such oscillators are somewhat easier to find than others, so many are
#C included in this collection.
#C
#C The 'period' of an oscillator (or spaceship) is the smallest positive
#C integer P for which generation P of the object is congruent to and in
#C the same orientation as generation 0.  The 'mod' of an oscillator (or
#C spaceship) is the smallest positive integer M for which generation M
#C of the object is congruent to generation 0, but not necessarily in the
#C same orientation.  The quotient q=P/M is always either 1, 2, or 4.  To
#C specify both P and M, we often write "period P.M" or "period P/q".
#C
#C There are 43 types of symmetry that an oscillator can have, taking into
#C account both the symmetry of a single generation and the change of
#C orientation (if any) M generations later.  There are 16 types of
#C symmetry that a pattern can have in a single generation.  Each of these
#C is given a one or two character name, as follows:
#C 
#C    n   no symmetry
#C 
#C    -c  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell centers
#C    -e  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell edges
#C 
#C    /   mirror symmetry across one diagonal
#C 
#C    .c  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    .e  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell edge
#C    .k  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    +c  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell center
#C    +e  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell edge
#C    +k  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell corner

#C For a period P/1 object, specifying the symmetry of generation 0 tells
#C us all there is to know about the oscillator's symmetry.  For a period
#C P/2 or P/4 object, we also need to know how gen M is related to gen 0.
#C For the P/2 case, gen M can be either a mirror image of gen 0, a 180
#C degree rotation of it, or a 90 degree rotation of it if the pattern
#C has 180 degree rotational symmetry.  For the P/4 case gen M must be a
#C 90 degree rotation of gen 0.  In any case, if we merge all gens which
#C are multiples of M, the resulting pattern will have more symmetry than
#C the original oscillator.  We describe the complete symmetry class of
#C the oscillator by appending the one or two character description of
#C the union's symmetry to that of gen 0's symmetry.  For example, if
#C gen 0 has 180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center, and
#C gen M is obtained by reflecting gen 0 across a diagonal, then the
#C union of gens 0 and M is symmetric across both diagonals, so its
#C symmetry class is denoted ".cxc".

#C To add an oscillator to oscillators.txt, all you need is the RLE and
#C optional comments. Make sure that there is no more than one #N or #O,
#C and #N comes before #O comes before #C. If the period is 1000 or more,
#C put a percent sign after the exclamation point at the end of the RLE,
#C and the period number after the percent sign.
#C While the file has oscillators sorted by period, the program will handle
#C them correctly even if they are out of order. If a pattern is not a
#C still life or oscillator, it will exclude it from the pattern, but it
#C will take an extra half second to figure this out unless it completely
#C dies first. Oscillators with width above 120 plus the digit width
#C or period >= 1000 with max bounding box expanding after generation 1000
#C are not supported unless the Python code is modified. ROW_WIDTH can be
#C changed at the top of the code to increase the allowed width above 120.
#C
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C Period 1 oscillators are usually called "still-lifes".  Programs
#C written by MDN and others have counted the still-lifes with N cells
#C for small N; the results up to N=20 are shown here:
#C 
#C N    4 5 6 7 8  9 10 11  12  13  14   15   16   17    18    19     20
#C #    2 1 5 4 9 10 25 46 121 240 619 1353 3286 7773 19044 45759 112243
#C 
#C Those with up to 10 bits are included in the stamp collection.  So are
#C some larger ones that either occur naturally in random soups, or are
#C useful, or exemplify symmetry types.  I'm omitting the discoverers and
#C dates for most of the small and naturally occurring ones, since they've
#C been independently discovered many times.
#C
#C Frequencies listed are for 16x16 soups on an infinite grid. Most objects
#C are 10 percent more common on a large torus (AF 2004, 2048x2048), at the
#C expense of the block, which is about 6 percent less common, and the ship,
#C which goes from 1 in 20 to 1 in 90.
#N 1.0.0 Block [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*k" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in many oscillators, too many to list. Also used as
#C       a 'rephaser' in P135, 150, 230, and 240 oscillators. In 47.0.0, it acts as
#C       an induction coil, preventing a line of 6 from growing new cells.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 2; the most common object in 16x16 soups;
#C       on a large torus, the blinker is slightly more common.
#C 1.0.1 Tub [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*c" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in most p29s, Eureka (P30), and 47.0.0.
#C       A tub can stabilize an exposed line of five. This is usually done when reducing
#C       population is the goal, but this collection is mainly optimized by bounding box,
#C       where snakes are better.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 65
#C 1.0.2 Boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "/" symmetry.
#C       A glider that hits a snake in the correct position will produce a boat while
#C       leaving the snake intact. See P60 section.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.3 Ship [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xc" symmetry.  Used as an
#C       eater of traffic lights in P24, 36, 44, 48, and 92 oscillators.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 20 in 16x16 soups, but this is because
#C       they form from Herschels. On a large torus, they are 1 in 90.
#C 1.0.4 Beehive [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "+e" symmetry.  This
#C       often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "honey farm", which
#C       arises, for example, from a beehive with an extra cell in one
#C       of its corners.
#C       A single beehive is also hassled in a P30 and P35 oscillator.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 4
#C 1.0.5 Aircraft carrier
#C       Example of ".e" symmetry.
#C       One of the 35 hexominoes becomes an aircraft carrier after one generation.
#C       .o..
#C       oooo
#C       ..o.
#C       Despite this, it's still quite rare for a 6-cell pattern, although not as
#C       rare as the snake or the clock.
#C       It's more common in HighLife (B36/S23), as the pi heptomino generates two of them.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 8,000
#C 1.0.6 Barge [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xk" symmetry.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 1,000
#C 1.0.7 Snake [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of ".k" symmetry.  Used in one P60 oscillator, 454.0.0,
#C       and 15240.0.0 to convert a glider into a boat, which a
#C       subsequent glider deletes.
#C       Used as a rock in the conduit "Conduit 1" (aka BFx59H), as seen in
#C       78.0.0, 98.0.0, and 190.0.0.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 30,000; rarest 6-bit still life
#C 1.0.8 Long snake
#C       Also called a python, not to be confused with the programming language
#C       Example of ".c" symmetry.
#C       Rarest of the 7-bit still lifes in natural soups, at 1 in 700,000
#C 1.0.9 Long boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 200
#C 1.0.10 Loaf [JHC group 1970]
#C        Loaves can be flipped easily; this is part of how eater 3 works. See P8, 106,
#C        and 133. Loaves can be flipped in other ways, too; see baker's dozen (P12),
#C        loaflipflop (P15), one of the P20s, zweiback (P30), and popover (P32).
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.11 Eater 1 [* 1971]
#C        Also called a fishhook
#C        This is a very useful still-life,
#C        because of its ability to eat gliders (see period 30 section), beehives
#C        (see period 30 section), and lightweight and middleweight spaceships
#C        (see period 46 section), and to modify many other things.  The term
#C        "eater" also applies to other still-lifes (and occasionally
#C        oscillators) that share this ability; the most useful of these
#C        are the block, eater 2, and eater 3, but
#C        many others are sometimes useful, including the tub,
#C        ship, and snake.
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 5,000

#C 2.0.0 Blinker [JHC 3/70]
#C       Example of "+c*c" symmetry.  This
#C       often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "traffic light",
#C       which arises, for example, from a T-tetromino.
#C       99.0% of oscillators from a random soup are blinkers.
#C       Most common object on a large torus; barely behind the block in
#C       a 16x16 soup if you count only surviving objects.
#C       Blinkers can be rephased; see 66P13, P35 traffic light hassler, and 47.0.0;
#C       since these numbers are odd, they would not work without rephasing.
#C 2.0.1 Toad [SN 5/70]
#C       Toads can be used as induction coils for rows that alternate 5 and 6 cells;
#C       there are several examples in the P2 section.
#C       See discussion of toad hasslers in the P60 section.
#C       Oscillator frequency: 1 in 130, total frequency: 1 in 375,

#C 28.0.0 [thunk, 2016]
#C 28.0.1
#C        Most known p29 oscillators and some p28s are "pre-pulsar hasslers".
#C        Consider a pair of hollow 3x3 squares, with 3 empty columns between them:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        After 15 generations, this becomes 4 hollow squares:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        (This goes on to become a p3 "pulsar" in gen 20.)  By repeatedly
#C        suppressing 2 of the hollow squares, we obtain oscillators of
#C        periods 30 and 60.
#C        
#C        It's also possible to suppress 2 of the squares in such a way that
#C        the other 2 form in gen 14 instead of 15; this leads to oscillators
#C        with periods 28 and 29.  Originally this required 8 pairs of squares
#C        supporting each other; DJB found the first p28 ("newshuttle", not
#C        included in this collection) in 1973.  Later, several methods were
#C        found which use either 1, 2, or 4 mutually supporting pairs.
#C        
#C        Note that DRH's original collection has more p29s. As many are
#C        very similar, they have been trimmed down here.

#C 30.0.0 Queen bee shuttle [RWG 1970]
#C        The central part (the shuttle) reappears, reflected across a vertical
#C        line, in 15 gens, but a beehive is also produced, which
#C        would destroy the shuttle.  The beehive can be destroyed
#C        by a block, as shown here, or by an eater in one of two
#C        different positions.

#C        unixes.  The unixes can also be replaced by period 5 or 47
#C        oscillators, giving periods 50+40n (see P50 section) and 282+376n
#C        (see 282.0.0), or by a larger p6 oscillator, giving period
#C        18 (see P18 section).  Also, by a lucky coincidence, the spacing
#C        between the gliders allows 2 pairs of gliders to cross using
#C        rephasers, giving periods 246+24n (see period 246), 230+40n
#C        (see period 230), and 846+376n (not shown).

#C 46.0.0 Twin bees shuttle [RWG 1071]
#C        The p46 shuttle, known as "twin bees", was discovered in

#C        either 1 or 2 blocks. If only 1 block is used,
#C        a large spark is produced which can reflect gliders and spaceships
#C        in several ways. Also see periods 92, 138, 184, 230, 276, 690, and 40894.

#C        works for even periods. For period 54 specifically, the eaters in the

#C 60.1.1 [NDE 5/30/98]
#C        Pre-pulsar hassled by four caterers
#C 60.1.2 p60, type -1 toadsucker
#C        A "toad hassler" is an oscillator in which a toad is changed by a
#C        pair of domino sparks above and below it.  It either moves 1 unit
#C        sideways ("toadsucker") or changes its orientation ("toadflipper").
#C        Amazingly, there are 5 different positions for the sparks which
#C        work; I call them "type -1" through "type 3", depending on the
#C        horizontal distance between the top and bottom sparks.  The odd types
#C        are toadsuckers; the even ones are toadflippers.  Given a period N
#C        oscillator which produces accessible domino sparks once per period,
#C        the resulting toad hasslers have period 4N if N is odd, 2N if N is
#C        even.  However, there are also some toad hasslers in which the period
#C        is smaller, either because the sparks occur more than once per period
#C        (see period 58) or because the interaction with the spark is more
#C        complicated (see period 56). Any oscillator that mentions
#C        "see period 60" uses this mechanism. Toad hassling was apparently
#C        first discovered by RTW in 6/84, using sparks from PDs and snackers to
#C        give p60 and p36 oscillators.

#C        A glider shuttles between 2 pairs of p30

#C         If the hasslers are phased differently, it's period 76.
#C         The loaf gets sparked and becomes a semi-common sequence of a pi plus

#C         A pre-honey farm

#C 400.0.0 P400 glider loop [RWG 1987]
#C         A glider bounces between 4 centinals.  By expanding the loop and using more than one
#C         glider, oscillators of period 100N can be built for any N.

#C 486.0.0 P486 R-pentomino hassler [DER 5/13/21]

#C 532.0.0 P532 gun [Entity Valkyrie 3/11/21]
#C         Capped in the form shown. To make it a gun, remove the two Eater 2s.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 552.0.0 [RWG ????, DRH 1/23/92 ]
#C         Glider loop based on the same
#C         reflection as in the p138 section.  Here the ponds are deleted by a
#C         p8 blocker.  The period of the loop can be anything of the
#C         form 138+184n, but the period of the oscillator is 4 times that.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 576.0.0 p576 R-pentomino hassler [DER 6/9/21]
#C         Compare to the very similar 486.0.0. It's a very high period R-pentomino
#C         hassler with period prime factorization containing only 2s and 3s, it's
#C         a flipper with 180 degree symmetry, it has blocks as suppressors on the top and
#C         bottom and sparkers on the left and right, and it was found by the same
#C         person in the same year using the same search program.
#C         Unrelated to the above: the blocks on the top and bottom are suppressing Herschels.
#C         It can easily be made into a glider gun. Also, the blocks on the left
#C         and right are optional, but if omitted, they'll form as the oscillator
#C         completes its cycle.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 690.0.0 [DRH 1/3/91]
#C         Sparks from a p46 shuttle interact 6 times with
#C         sparks from a p15 pentadecathlon; one interaction makes a
#C         temporary blinker.

#C 972.0.0 [Aforampere 5/13/21]
#C         Two p486 R-pentomino hasslers undergo a period-doubling reaction.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 1368.0.0 p1368 LCM loaf flipper [DER 11/1/21]
#C          On the left is two blockers hassling R-pentomino (p72), and on the
#C          right is the p76 pi-heptomino hassler. The LCM of these is 1368.
#C          Also see the period 120 section for the same loaf-flipping reaction
#C          in a different form.

#C 1380.0.0 p1380 crystallization and decay gun [Entity Valkyrie 5/1/21]
#C          A Tanner's p46 and a twin bees shuttle create a p92 glider gun.
#C          The crystallization and decay releases a glider for every 15 input gliders.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 2700.0.0 p2700 crystallization and decay oscillator [DRH 3/27/90]
#C          Extensible to period 2700+1950N.  A p150 gun shoots gliders
#C          toward a pair of PDs.  The first is reflected 180 degrees
#C          and hits the second, forming a honey farm.  Subsequent
#C          gliders grow a crystal back toward the gun; every 11
#C          gliders add another pair of beehives to the crystal.
#C          Eventually, an eater stops the growth and the crystal
#C          begins to decay: two successive gliders delete one pair of
#C          beehives.  (This is based on an earlier pattern found and
#C          lost by RWG, using a p46 gun.)
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 15240.0.0 p120-based PRNG [DRH 3/21/92]
#C           Pseudo random number generator,
#C           based on an earlier pattern by RWG (a larger
#C           version of 40894.0.0).  Produces a sequence of bits b[n],
#C           represented by gliders, satisfying the recurrence
#C           b[n] = b[n-1] XOR b[n-7].  The sequence has period 127,
#C           so the period of the pattern is 120*127.  Increasing the
#C           separation between the NW and SE parts by 15N units
#C           diagonally changes the 7 above to K=7+N  (N >= -4).  The
#C           period of the sequence depends rather erratically on K:
#C           
#C           K | 2 3  4  5  6   7  8  9  10   11   12   13    14    15

#C           
#C           Also see 40894.0.0.  (In 1996, DRH built a p30-based PRNG.)
#C           This uses a "boat-bit", a reaction in which gliders hitting
#C           a snake alternately create and destroy a boat. 
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 40894.0.0 p46-based PRNG
#C           RWG ????, DRH 1/10/95
#C           Pseudo random LWSS generator. Produces a sequence of bits b[n],
#C           represented by LWSSs, satisfying the recurrence
#C           b[n] = b[n-1] EQV b[n-10].  The sequence has period 889,
#C           so the period of the pattern is 46*889. Moving the bottom
#C           right gun and the reflector at the right edge 46N units
#C           farther right changes the 10 above to  K=10+4N  (N>=0).
#C           The period of the sequence depends on K as indicated in
#C           the description of 15240.0.0.
