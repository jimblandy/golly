<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<p>
This section lists all known bugs and limitations.
If you come across any problems not mentioned below then please
report them to Andrew Trevorrow
(<a href="mailto:andrew@trevorrow.com">andrew@trevorrow.com</a>).

<p>
<ul>
<li>
All editing operations are restricted to cells whose coordinates
are within +/- 1 billion.  Not much of a limitation really!
<li>
The QuickLife algorithm has a minor bug that can cause selecting
a large pattern to appear to be incorrect.  The selection is actually
correct but the rectangle is slightly offset (by one pixel).
</ul>
    
<p>
The iOS version of Golly has a number of significant limitations
when compared with the desktop version:
<ul>
<li> No scripting.
<li> No multiple layers.
<li> No timelines.
<li> No auto fit mode.
<li> No hyperspeed mode.
<li> You can't change the colors, base step, or origin.
</ul>
Some of these capabilities might be added in future versions.
