<title>Golly Help: View Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Full Screen</b></font>

<p>
Switches to full screen mode.  To exit from this mode just hit the menu item's
keyboard shortcut, or the escape key (if not generating a pattern),
or any unassigned key.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire pattern fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Selection</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire selection fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Middle</b></font>

<p>
Moves the origin cell (0,0) to the middle of the view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Restore Origin</b></font>

<p>
Restores the true origin.
The origin cell can be changed by hitting "0" while the cursor is over the
view &mdash; the cell under the cursor will become the new origin and its location
will be displayed as 0,0.  This can be handy for measuring distances or for
saving a location and returning to it quickly by hitting "m".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom In</b></font>

<p>
Zooms in by doubling the current scale.
If the scale is 1:32 then you can't zoom in any further.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom Out</b></font>

<p>
Zooms out by halving the current scale.
You can zoom out as far as you like.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Set Scale</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you set the scale from 1:1 to 1:32.
(A quicker is to use keyboard shortcuts.  The initial shortcuts are:
"1" for 1:1, "2" for 1:2, "4" for 1:4, "8" for 1:8, "6" for 1:16 and "3" for 1:32.)

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Tool Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the tool bar at the left edge of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Layer Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the layer bar above the viewport window (and above the
edit bar if it's visible).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Edit Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the edit bar above the viewport window.
The edit bar contains buttons for undo and redo, buttons for
changing the cursor mode, a button for showing/hiding all states
(see below), boxes showing the current drawing state's color and
icon, and a scroll bar for changing the drawing state.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show All States</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the edit bar is made larger and the colors and icons
for all cell states in the current universe are displayed.
A box is drawn around the current drawing state; to change it just
click on a different state.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Status Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the status bar at the top of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Exact Numbers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the status bar is made larger and exact numbers are
displayed instead of using scientific notation.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Grid Lines</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the grid lines.
Use <a href="prefs:view">Preferences > View</a>
to turn off the bold grid lines or change their spacing.
You can also set the minimum scale at which grid lines should be displayed
(1:4, 1:8, 1:16 or 1:32).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Cell Icons</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then icons will be displayed at scales 1:8, 1:16 or 1:32.
Icons are small bitmaps that can have any shape but their color is
automatically synchronized with the cell's state color.
Each algorithm can have a different set of icons.  You can change these
icons by loading suitably formatted files via the "Load Icons" button
in <a href="prefs:color">Preferences > Color</a>.

<p>
It's also possible to have rule-specific icons.  Whenever Golly
switches to a new rule it looks inside the Rules folder for a matching
<i>rule</i>.icons file and, if it exists, loads the bitmaps stored in
the file.  The format of a .icons file is identical to that used above.
See <a href="formats.html#icons">Help > File Formats</a> for a
description of the format.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Invert Colors</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the colors of all cell states in all layers are inverted;
i.e., each RGB value is changed to 255-R, 255-G, 255-B.

<a name="smart"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Smarter Scaling</b></font>

<p>
If not ticked then Golly displays patterns at zoomed out scales by drawing
all live cells using the state 1 color, regardless of the cell states.
If this option is ticked then patterns will be scaled in a way that shows
the correct colors, but only at scales from 2:1 to 16:1.

<p>
Note that pattern rendering is significantly slower using this scaling option,
so it's probably best to only turn it on when you need to see fine details.
Define a <a href="prefs:keyboard">keyboard shortcut</a> for this menu item
so you can easily turn the option on or off.

<a name="timeline"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Timeline</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the timeline bar below the viewport window.
If the current algorithm supports timelines (all except QuickLife and Larger than Life)
then the timeline bar has a button to start/stop recording a timeline.
This button is equivalent to the Control menu's
<a href="control.html#record">Start/Stop Recording</a> item.

<p>
When recording stops, or after a timeline is loaded from a .mc file,
you'll see a scroll bar that lets you view any frame within the timeline.
There are also buttons to automatically play the timeline
forwards or backwards, a slider to adjust the speed of auto-play,
and a button at the right edge to delete the timeline.
Note that if the Control menu's Auto Fit option is ticked then Golly
will force each timeline pattern to fit the viewport.

<p>
A number of keyboard shortcuts can be used while a timeline exists.
Hit the escape key to stop recording or to stop auto-play.
Hit your preferred keys for Faster/Slower to change the speed of auto-play.
Hit your preferred key for Start Generating to play the timeline forwards
and, if you wish, use <a href="prefs:keyboard">Preferences > Keyboard</a>
to assign a keyboard shortcut for Play Timeline Backwards.

<a name="scrollbars"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Scroll Bars</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the scroll bars.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Pattern Info</b></font>

<p>
Displays any comments in the current pattern file.
