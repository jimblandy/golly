<font size=+1><b>The pioneers</b></font>

<p>
First and foremost, a big thanks to John Conway for creating the Game of Life,
and to Martin Gardner for popularizing the topic in his Scientific American
column.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>The programmers</b></font>

<p>
Tom Rokicki wrote most of the complicated stuff.
Golly is essentially the merging of two of Tom's programs (hlife and qlife).
The HashLife algorithm is based on an idea by Bill Gosper.
The QuickLife algorithm uses some ideas from Alan Hensel.
David Eppstein provided the idea on how to emulate B0 rules.
The speed of the Larger than Life algorithm is mainly due to some clever ideas
from Adam P. Goucher and Dean Hickerson.

<p>
Andrew Trevorrow wrote the cross-platform GUI code using
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.
Much thanks to Julian Smart, Vadim Zeitlin, Stefan Csomor and all the other
wxWidgets developers.

<p>
Golly's scripting capabilities are thanks to the generosity and efforts of
Eugene Langvagen (author of <a href="http://plife.sourceforge.net/">PLife</a>),
Guido van Rossum (creator of <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>),
and Roberto Ierusalimschy and all the other <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>
developers.

<p>
Golly uses the cute_sound library from the
<a href="https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers">cute_headers</a> project
to play sounds, so much thanks to Randy Gaul.

<p>
Tim Hutton wrote the RuleTable algorithm (now merged into the RuleLoader algorithm)
and created the excellent
<a href="http://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository">Rule Table Repository</a>.

<p>
Chris Rowett wrote the Super algorithm and added support for many new rule types
in the other algorithms.  Chris has also made significant contributions to the
overlay and the rendering code.

<p>
Dongook Lee added support for Python 3.

<p>
Various code and documentation improvements have been contributed by Dave Greene,
Jason Summers, Maks Verver, Robert Munafo and Brenton Bostick.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>The beta testers</b></font>

<p>
Thanks to all the bug hunters for their reports and suggestions,
especially Dave Greene, Gabriel Nivasch, Dean Hickerson, Brice Due,
David Eppstein, Tony Smith, Alan Hensel, Dennis Langdeau, Bill Gosper,
Mark Jeronimus, Eric Goldstein and Arie Paap.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Other contributors</b></font>

<p>
Dave Greene and Alan Hensel helped put together the pattern collection.
Thanks to everybody who allowed us to distribute their fantastic patterns,
especially Nick Gotts, Gabriel Nivasch, David Eppstein, Jason Summers,
Stephen Morley, Dean Hickerson, Brice Due, William R. Buckley, David Moore,
Mark Owen, Tim Hutton, Renato Nobili, Adam P. Goucher, David Bell and
Kenichi Morita.

<p>
Thanks to Stephen Silver for compiling the wonderful
<a href="Lexicon/lex.htm">Life Lexicon</a>.

<p>
Thanks to Nathaniel Johnston for creating the brilliant
<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/">LifeWiki</a>
and for making its patterns available to Golly users via an
<a href="get:https://conwaylife.com/golly.html">online archive</a>.
