<p><a name=uc>:</a><b>UC</b> = <a href="#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>.
<p><a name=underpopulation>:</a><b>underpopulation</b> Death of a cell caused by it having fewer than two
<a href="lex_n.htm#neighbor">neighbors</a>. See also <a href="lex_o.htm#overpopulation">overpopulation</a>.
<p><a name=unitcell>:</a><b>unit cell</b> = <a href="#unitlifecell">unit Life cell</a>.
<p><a name=unitlifecell>:</a><b>unit Life cell</b> A rectangular pattern, of size greater than 1x1, that
can simulate Life in the following sense. The pattern by itself
represents a dead Life cell, and some other pattern represents a live
Life cell. When the plane is tiled by these two patterns (which then
represent the state of a whole Life universe) they evolve, after a
fixed amount of time, into another tiling of the plane by the same
two patterns which correctly represents the Life generation following
the one they initially represented.
<p>It is usual to use the prefix "meta-" for simulated Life features,
so, for example, for the first known unit Life cell (constructed by
David Bell in January 1996), one metatick is 5760 <a href="lex_t.htm#tick">ticks</a>, and one
<a href="lex_m.htm#metacell">metacell</a> is 500x500 cells. Capital letters were originally used to
make this distinction - e.g., Generation, Cell - but this usage is no
longer common.
<p>In December 2005, Jason Summers constructed an analogous unit cell
for Wolfram's Rule 110, a one-dimensional <a href="lex_c.htm#cellularautomaton">cellular automaton</a> that
is known be universal. See also <a href="lex_o.htm#otcametapixel">OTCA metapixel</a>, <a href="lex_p.htm#p1megacell">p1 megacell</a>.
<p><a name=universal>:</a><b>universal</b> See <a href="#universalcomputer">universal computer</a>, <a href="#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>,
<a href="#universaltoolkit">universal toolkit</a>.
<p><a name=universalcomputer>:</a><b>universal computer</b> A computer that can compute anything that is
computable. (The concept of computability can be defined in terms of
Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number of
other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent
definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill Gosper
and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to construct a
universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove the universality
of a <a href="lex_c.htm#cellularautomaton">cellular automaton</a> with simple rules was in fact Conway's aim
in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof is outlined in
<a href="lex_w.htm#winningways">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="lex_t.htm#therecursiveuniverse">The Recursive Universe</a>.
<p>Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in
practice In April 2000, Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine
construction (see <a href="http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm">http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm</a> for details).
This, however, has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of
a true Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.
But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction of a
universal computer, see
<a href="http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/">http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/</a>. This is a universal
register machine based around Dean Hickerson's
<a href="lex_s.htm#slidingblockmemory">sliding block memory</a>.
<p>In 2009 Adam P. Goucher constructed a programmable <a href="lex_s.htm#spartan">Spartan</a>
universal computer/constructor pattern using stable <a href="lex_h.htm#herschel">Herschel</a>
circuitry. It included memory tapes and registers capable of holding
a simple universal instruction set and program data, and also a
minimal <a href="lex_s.htm#singlearm">single-arm</a> universal constructor. Its size meant that it
was extremely impractical to program it to be <a href="lex_s.htm#selfconstructing">self-constructing</a>,
though this was theoretically possible if the escape of large numbers
of gliders could be allowed as a side effect.
<p>In February 2010, Paul Rendell completed a universal Turing machine
design with an unlimited tape, as described in his thesis at
<a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf">http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf</a>.
<p>In 2016 Nicolas Loizeau ("Coban") completed a Life pattern
emulating a complete 8-bit programmable computer.
<p>See also <a href="#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>.
<p><a name=universalconstructor>:</a><b>universal constructor</b> A pattern that is capable of constructing
almost any pattern that has a <a href="lex_g.htm#glidersynthesis">glider synthesis</a>. This definition is
a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it is not
known, for example, whether all <a href="lex_s.htm#stilllife">still lifes</a> are constructible. In
any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct
itself in order to qualify as such.
<p>An outline of Conway's proof that such a pattern exists can be
found in <a href="lex_w.htm#winningways">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="lex_t.htm#therecursiveuniverse">The Recursive Universe</a>. The
key mechanism for the production of gliders with any given path and
timing is known as side-tracking, and is based on the
<a href="lex_k.htm#kickbackreaction">kickback reaction</a>. A universal constructor designed in this way
can also function as a universal destructor: it can delete almost
any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.
<p>In May 2004, Paul Chapman and Dave Greene produced a prototype
programmable universal constructor. This is able to construct
objects by means of <a href="lex_s.htm#slowgliderconstruction">slow glider constructions</a>. It likely that it
could be programmed to construct itself, but the necessary program
would be very large; moreover an additional mechanism would be needed
in order to copy the program.
<p>A universal constructor is theoretically most useful when attached
to a <a href="#universalcomputer">universal computer</a>, which can be programmed to control the
constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what
follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes
this computer.
<p>The existence of a universal constructor/destructor has a number of
theoretical consequences.
<p>For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of
itself. This is a <a href="lex_r.htm#replicator">replicator</a>.
<p>The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy of
itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself. This
would be a (very large, very high period) <a href="lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a>. Any
translation is possible, so that the spaceship could travel in any
direction. If the constructor makes a rotated but unreflected copy
of itself, the result would be a looping spaceship or
<a href="lex_r.htm#reflectorlessrotatingoscillator">reflectorless rotating oscillator</a>.
<p>The constructor could also travel slower than any given speed,
since we could program it to perform some time-wasting task (such as
repeatedly constructing and deleting a block) before copying itself.
Of course, we could also choose for it to leave some debris behind,
thus making a <a href="lex_p.htm#puffer">puffer</a>.
<p>It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal
constructor implies the existence of a <a href="lex_s.htm#stable">stable</a> <a href="lex_r.htm#reflector">reflector</a>. This
proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance
now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.
<p>Progressively smaller universal-constructor mechanisms without an
attached universal computer have been used in the
<a href="lex_l.htm#linearpropagator">linear propagator</a>, <a href="lex_s.htm#spiralgrowth">spiral growth</a> pattern, and the <a href="lex_d.htm#demonoid">Demonoids</a> and
<a href="lex_o.htm#orthogonoid">Orthogonoid</a>. See also <a href="lex_s.htm#singlechannel">single-channel</a>.
<p>Another strange consequence of the existence of universal
constructors was pointed out by Adam P. Goucher and Tanner Jacobi in
2015. Any glider-constructible pattern, no matter how large, can be
constructed with a fixed number of gliders, by working out a
construction recipe for a universal constructor attached to a decoder
that measures the distance to a faraway object. The object's
position encodes a numeric value that can be processed to retrieve as
many bits of information as are needed to build a <a href="lex_s.htm#slowsalvo">slow salvo</a> to
construct any given target pattern. The simplest design, requiring
less than a hundred gliders, is described in <a href="lex_r.htm#reversecabertosser">reverse caber tosser</a>.
<p><a name=universaldestructor>:</a><b>universal destructor</b> See <a href="#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>.
<p><a name=universalregistermachine>:</a><b>universal register machine</b> = <a href="#urm">URM</a>
<p><a name=universalregulator>:</a><b>universal regulator</b> A <a href="lex_r.htm#regulator">regulator</a> in which the incoming gliders are
aligned to period 1, that is, they have arbitrary timing (subject to
some minimum time required for the regulator to recover from the
previous glider).
<p>Paul Chapman constructed the first universal regulator in March
2003. It is adjustable, so that the output can be aligned to any
desired period. A <a href="lex_s.htm#stable">stable</a> universal regulator was constructed by
Dave Greene in September 2015, with a minimum delay between test
signals of 1177 ticks. Later stable versions have reduced the delay
to 952 ticks.
<p>A universal regulator can allow two complex <a href="lex_c.htm#circuit">circuits</a> to interact
safely, even if they have different base <a href="lex_p.htm#period">periods</a>. For example,
signals from a <a href="lex_s.htm#stable">stable</a> logic circuit could be processed by a
period-30 mechanism, though the precise timing of those signals would
change in most cases.
<p><a name=universaltoolkit>:</a><b>universal toolkit</b> A set of Life reactions and mechanisms that can be
used to construct any object that can be constructed by glider
collisions. Different universal toolkits were used to construct the
<a href="lex_l.htm#linearpropagator">linear propagator</a>, <a href="lex_1.htm#a-10hddemonoid">10hd Demonoid</a>, <a href="lex_1.htm#a-0hddemonoid">0hd Demonoid</a>, and
<a href="lex_o.htm#orthogonoid">Orthogonoid</a>, for example.
<p><a name=universe>:</a><b>universe</b> The topology of the cells in the Life grid. In the normal
universe (the usual <a href="lex_l.htm#life">Life</a> arena), the grid is infinite in both
directions. In a cylindrical universe, the grid is finite in one
direction, and the cells at the two edges are adjacent to each other.
In a <a href="lex_t.htm#torus">torus</a> universe, the grid is finite in both directions, and the
cells at the top and bottom edges are adjacent, and the cells at the
left and right edges are adjacent. There are several other more
obscure types of universe.
<p>Objects found in the cylindrical and toroidal universes can also
run in the normal universe if an infinite number of copies are
arranged to support each other. Sometimes the objects can be
supported in other ways to make a useful finite object. This is one
reason that <a href="lex_s.htm#soup">soup</a> searches are run in alternative universes, to find
such objects.
<p><a name=unix>:</a><b>unix</b> (p6) Two <a href="lex_b.htm#block">blocks</a> eating a <a href="lex_l.htm#longbarge">long barge</a>. This is a useful
<a href="lex_s.htm#sparker">sparker</a>, found by Dave Buckingham in February 1976. The name
derives from the fact that it was for some time the mascot of the
Unix lab of the mathematics faculty at the University of Waterloo.

<p><a name=unknownfate>:</a><b>unknown fate</b> An object whose <a href="lex_f.htm#fate">fate</a> is in some way unanswerable with
our current knowledge. The simplest way that the fate of an object
can be unknown involves the question of whether or not it exhibits
infinite growth. For example, the fate of the
<a href="lex_f.htm#fermatprimecalculator">Fermat prime calculator</a> is currently unknown, but its behavior is
otherwise predictable.
<p>A different type of unknown fate is that of the
<a href="lex_c.htm#collatz5n1simulator">Collatz 5N+1 simulator</a>, which may become stable, or an oscillator,
or have an indefinitely growing bounding box. Its behavior is
otherwise predictable, and unlike the Fermat prime calculator the
population is known to be bounded.
